Hey! My name is Amaël Rosales and I am 19 years old. I've always been passionate about computers science since I was a child. I started my studies around the age of 14 when I learned digital systems. More specifically, I learned to master Linux, the Raspberrys, I also programmed in Python, and many notions of network architecture and network equipment. 

Then, at the age of 17, I did an Associate Degree (digital computer systems and network) which was the logical continuation of my studies. Very oriented embedded system, these studies has taught me to code in language C/C++ (POO, Heritage, Polymorphism, etc. And the algorithmic it goes without saying:) I learned the UML that allows to make the software architecture, creates, manage, maintain databases, analyze data frames, applied physics (colorimetry, optical fiber, Analog/Digital filter, etc.). I also worked on IoT for 6 months (internet of things) for a school project.

After finishing my studies, I was frustrated that I had not discovered the world of the web in more depth, which is why even before I finished my studies, I began to train myself in self-taught, Because the idea of being a web developer and making it my profession was running through my mind. I needed a program well done to be able to train myself completely without having to go back to long studies. That’s why I turned to O'clock School, which taught me everything I needed to be hired.
